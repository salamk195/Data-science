My introduction to data science course has been a transformative experience. I began by learning how to collect and process data from various sources, ensuring its quality through cleaning and preprocessing.

Next, I explored data visualization, using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visuals that highlight patterns and trends.

Understanding data storage was crucial, as I delved into both SQL and NoSQL databases for efficient data management.

Machine learning was a highlight, where I studied algorithms like linear regression and neural networks, applying them to real-world problems.

Throughout, I gained insights into different data types and their unique challenges.

This journey has equipped me with the skills to turn raw data into valuable insights, fueling my passion for data science.

I also created an article on the completion of this course, this is the link to read my article: https://medium.com/@abdulsalamawosanya5/from-raw-data-to-real-insights-my-data-science-journey-455ceda10ead
